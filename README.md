# django-improv

## Purpose
This is a django app built to allow audiences to interact with live shows. It allows them to use their mobile browsers to enter suggestions, vote live during the show, and be tracked on a leaderboard.

It allows show administrators to create interactive shows and capture audience emails if the log in with either Facebook or Google.

## Technical Details
This was built to run on a VM. It's also not very up-to-date because I stopped developing on it when we ended the show. I used bfg to scrub keys/tokens/secrets.

## About
I originally developed this for long-form improv, but it really works best for short-form. It can be used to support as many shows, theaters, and teams as you want.

This also supports cage match style shows for voting between teams.

The audience paricipation side is easy and very straightforward.

You can also capture audience member's emails using this app (reminder that spamming is illegal and you should follow the CAN-SPAM Act).

## Contributions
I would love it if someone picked up and ran with this project. It needs updating, but is a really cool app once it's up and running. It needs a lot of UX work to make the show creation process more intuitive for administrators.

## How it Works/Worked

...coming soon.
